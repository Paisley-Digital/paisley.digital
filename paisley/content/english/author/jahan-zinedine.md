Hey, I'm Jahan, a well-rounded resourceful linchpin engineer with 20+ years of experience developing banking and business-critical software applications, mainly as an architect and technical lead, always committed to delivering quality work I feel proud of.

If you have a product idea and want to build it, stuck with your legacy codebase, or spent so much on tech without much return, I can help, letâ€™s have talk!
